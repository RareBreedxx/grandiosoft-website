    Grandiosoft Technology designs systems using principles commonly found in
    distributed and resilient environments. These principles guide all
    infrastructure and delivery decisions.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Distributed Responsibility</h2>
  <p>
    Systems should not depend on a single component or individual.
    Reliability improves when responsibility is distributed and coordination
    between components is explicit.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Automation by Default</h2>
  <p>
    Repeatable processes are automated to reduce error, increase consistency,
    and support scalability across environments.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Resilience Through Recovery</h2>
  <p>
    Failure is treated as an expected condition. Systems are designed to
    detect, absorb, and recover from failure with minimal disruption.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Simplicity and Clarity</h2>
  <p>
    Complexity introduces operational risk. Clear structure, minimal design,
    and well-documented systems improve long-term maintainability.
